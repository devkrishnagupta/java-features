# Flyweight Design Pattern
The Flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern that minimizes memory usage by sharing common objects as much as possible. It is particularly useful in scenarios where a large number of similar objects need to be created and managed. The pattern achieves this by separating an objectâ€™s intrinsic state (shared among multiple objects) from its extrinsic state (unique to each object).

##Components of the Flyweight Pattern
Flyweight Interface/Abstract Class: This defines the interface for concrete flyweights. Typically, it includes a method to accept and process the extrinsic state.
Concrete Flyweight: These are the actual flyweight objects that implement the Flyweight interface. They store intrinsic states that can be shared among multiple objects.
Flyweight Factory: This is responsible for creating and managing flyweight objects. It ensures that flyweights are shared and reused as much as possible.
Client: The client code uses flyweights to create and manipulate objects. It passes the extrinsic state to the flyweights when needed.
