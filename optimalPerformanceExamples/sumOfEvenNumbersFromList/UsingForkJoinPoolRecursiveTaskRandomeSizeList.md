- This implementation uses Java's `ForkJoinPool` and `RecursiveTask` to divide the list recursively and compute the sum of even numbers.

- The `EvenSumTask` class extends `RecursiveTask<Integer>` and overrides the `compute()` method to perform the computation.

- If the size of the list is below a certain threshold (`THRESHOLD`), the `sequentialSum()` method calculates the sum of even numbers sequentially.

- If the size exceeds the threshold, the list is divided into two sublists, and separate `EvenSumTask` instances are created for each sublist.

- The `invokeAll()` method invokes the tasks asynchronously, and `join()` is used to obtain the results from subtasks and calculate the final sum.

This approach utilizes the Fork-Join framework for parallel computation and is particularly effective for dividing tasks recursively, allowing for efficient processing of large datasets by leveraging multiple threads. Adjust the `THRESHOLD` value as needed for optimal performance based on the size of the list.
