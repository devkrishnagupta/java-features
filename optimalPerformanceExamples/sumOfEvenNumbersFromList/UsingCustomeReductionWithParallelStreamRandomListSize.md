- This approach uses Java Streams' `parallelStream()` to enable parallel processing of the list.

- The `collect()` method with a custom reduction operation is employed to compute the sum of even numbers.

- The `accumulate()` method accumulates the even numbers into an `AtomicInteger` sum.

- The `combine()` method combines partial results from different threads.

*This approach demonstrates another way to perform parallel reduction using Java Streams, allowing for efficient computation of the sum of even numbers from a list in a parallelized manner. Adjustments or enhancements to the reduction operation can be made based on specific requirements.*
