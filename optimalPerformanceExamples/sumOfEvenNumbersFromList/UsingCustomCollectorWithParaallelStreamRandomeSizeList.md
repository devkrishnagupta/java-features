- This approach uses Java Streams' `parallelStream()` to enable parallel processing of the list.

- A custom collector named `EvenNumberSumCollector` is implemented by implementing the `Collector` interface.

- The `EvenNumberSumCollector` defines methods like `supplier()`, `accumulator()`, `combiner()`, `finisher()`, and `characteristics()` to define the logic for collecting even numbers and summing them up.

- `supplier()` creates an array to store the sum of even numbers.
- `accumulator()` accumulates the even numbers into the array.
- `combiner()` combines partial results in case of parallel processing.
- `finisher()` returns the final result.
- The custom collector is used with collect() in the parallelStream() to compute the sum of even numbers in the list.

*This approach uses a custom collector to perform the summing of even numbers in parallel using Java Streams, offering another method for efficient computation in a parallelized manner. Adjustments or enhancements to the collector's behavior can be made based on specific requirements.*
