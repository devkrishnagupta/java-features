**1. Generating Random List:**
- The program starts by using the `Random` class to generate a `random` size for the list (`listSize`) between 1 and 10.
- It then creates an ArrayList named `numbers` to store random elements.

**2. Filling the List:**
- A loop fills the `numbers` list with random integers between 0 and 99. The number of elements is based on the previously generated `listSize`.

**3. Printing the Generated List:**
- It displays the generated list of random numbers.

**4. Multithreaded Sum Computation:**
- The program creates a fixed thread pool using `ExecutorService` with a specified number of threads (`threadCount` is set to 5 in this example).

**5. Dividing List into Sublists:**
- The list is divided into `threadCount` sublists, aiming for equal distribution among threads.

**6. Parallel Processing with Threads:**
- For each sublist, a lambda expression representing a `Runnable` task is executed using the `execute()` method of the `ExecutorService`.
- Each task is responsible for computing the sum of even numbers in its assigned sublist using the `stream()` API and `filter()` to filter even numbers, `mapToInt()` to convert to an `IntStream`, and sum() to calculate the sum.
- The computed local sums are then added to a shared `AtomicInteger` variable `sum` using `addAndGet()` to ensure thread safety.

**7. Shutting Down the Executor Service:**
- The executor service is shut down after all tasks are submitted for execution.

**8. Waiting for Threads to Finish:**
- The program waits until all threads in the executor service have completed their tasks by using a loop that checks if the executor has terminated.

**9 Displaying the Sum of Even Numbers:**
- Finally, it prints the total sum of all even numbers in the generated list.

*This code demonstrates a simple example of dividing a list into smaller parts and processing them concurrently using multithreading to calculate the sum of even numbers. It showcases the usage of `ExecutorService` and how tasks can be divided among threads for parallel execution, enhancing performance for certain computational tasks. Adjustments to the number of threads and sublist sizes can be made based on the application's requirements for optimal performance.*
