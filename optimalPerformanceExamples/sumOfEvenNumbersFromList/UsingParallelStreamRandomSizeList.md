- This implementation uses Java Streams with parallel processing to filter and compute the sum of even numbers.

- The `parallelStream()` method is invoked on the `numbers` list to create a parallel stream for parallel processing.

- `filter()` is used to filter out the even numbers from the list.

- `mapToInt()` converts the stream of integers to an `IntStream`.

- Finally, `sum()` calculates the sum of all even numbers in parallel.

*This approach takes advantage of Java's Stream API, enabling parallel execution of operations on collections. The `parallelStream()` method automatically utilizes multiple threads for computation, improving performance for larger datasets. It simplifies the code and allows for concise and efficient processing of the list elements. Adjustments or additional operations can be applied within the stream pipeline as needed for different use cases.*
