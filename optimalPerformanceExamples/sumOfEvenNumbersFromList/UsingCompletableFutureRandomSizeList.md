- This implementation uses `CompletableFuture` to perform asynchronous computation of the sum of even numbers in sublists of the generated list.

- The generated list is divided into `threadCount` sublists.

- For each sublist, a `CompletableFuture` is created using `supplyAsync()` to perform the computation of the sum of even numbers asynchronously.

- All these `CompletableFuture` instances are stored in an array.

- `CompletableFuture.allOf()` is used to wait for all futures to complete their computations.

- Once all computations are finished, the results from each CompletableFuture are retrieved using future.get() and summed up to obtain the total sum of even numbers.

*This approach uses asynchronous computation to process sublists concurrently, providing an alternative way to achieve parallelism and improve performance in calculating the sum of even numbers from a list. Adjust the threadCount variable based on the available resources or specific requirements.*
