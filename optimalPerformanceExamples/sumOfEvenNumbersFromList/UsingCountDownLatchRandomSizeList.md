- This approach creates multiple threads using Java's `Thread` class to compute the sum of even numbers in sublists of the generated list.

- The CountDownLatch is used to ensure that the main thread waits until all worker threads have finished their computations.

- Each thread is responsible for computing the sum of even numbers in its assigned sublist.

- After completing its computation, each thread updates a totalSum variable which is shared among all threads.

- The await() method on the CountDownLatch waits for all threads to count down before proceeding to print the total sum of even numbers.

*This approach demonstrates another way of utilizing multiple threads and coordination via CountDownLatch to parallelize the computation of the sum of even numbers from a list. Adjust the threadCount variable based on the available resources or specific requirements.*
